Geoff Bunza's JMRI Sensor Scan

These files were originally hosted on this website: https://forum.mrhmag.com/post/sma28-jmri-sensor-channels-%E2%80%93-direct-arduino-to-jmri-communications-simple-support-for-lots-of-12210793

However, the link to the files no longer works. I have hosted the files here, but all credit should go to Geoff Bunza for developing this system.
